The process of drawing and generating data from an unknown distribution is fundamental in many
scientific fields. In past years, unsupervised machine learning techniques have been increasingly
investigated for their ability to learn correlations in unlabeled data. This work focuses on Restricted
Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), which are used to highlight the underlying patterns of real data
and to reproduce them. The main challenge, however, is modelling and training these networks.
Throughout this work, different ways of improving a RBM and different methods of measuring its
performance are employed on two mock datasets. Overall, we find that simple models work better.
